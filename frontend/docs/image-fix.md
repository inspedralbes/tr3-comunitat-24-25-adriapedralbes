# Static Image Fix Documentation

## Problem
The application was encountering a 404 error when trying to load the logo image (`/logo_futurprive_sinfondo.png`), despite the file existing in the public directory. The error messages indicated:

```
GET /logo_futurprive_sinfondo.png 404 in 122ms
тип The requested resource isn't a valid image for /logo_futurprive_sinfondo.png received text/html; charset=utf-8
```

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by one of the following factors:

1. **Docker Volume Configuration**: The volume for the public directory was using a named volume (`nextjs_public:/app/public`) instead of a direct bind mount, which might cause inconsistencies in how files are accessed.

2. **Next.js Image Optimization**: The default Next.js image optimization might have had issues processing the PNG file within the Docker container.

## Solution Implemented

Several changes were made to fix the issue:

### 1. Created a Fallback Logo Component

A new `Logo` component was created that attempts to load the image using Next.js `Image` component first, but falls back to a standard HTML `img` tag if loading fails:

```tsx
// src/components/Logo.tsx
'use client';

import Image from 'next/image';
import { useState } from 'react';

export function Logo({ width = 96, height = 96, className = "" }) {
  const [fallbackToImg, setFallbackToImg] = useState(false);
  
  return fallbackToImg ? (
    <img 
      src="/logo_futurprive_sinfondo.png" 
      alt="FuturPrive Logo" 
      width={width}
      height={height}
      className={className}
    />
  ) : (
    <Image 
      src="/logo_futurprive_sinfondo.png" 
      alt="FuturPrive Logo" 
      width={width}
      height={height}
      className={className}
      priority
      unoptimized={true}
      onError={() => setFallbackToImg(true)}
    />
  );
}
```

### 2. Updated Components to Use the Logo Component

The relevant components were updated to use the new Logo component:

- `src/components/Newsletter/hero/newsletter-hero.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`

### 3. Modified Docker Volume Configuration

The Docker Compose file was updated to use a direct bind mount for the public directory instead of a named volume:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./frontend:/app
  - node_modules:/app/node_modules
  - ./frontend/public:/app/public # Direct mount for static files
```

This ensures that files in the public directory are directly accessible to the Next.js application without any potential issues with named volumes.

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Resilience**: The fallback mechanism ensures that even if Next.js Image optimization fails, the logo will still be displayed using a standard img tag.

2. **Consistency**: Using a dedicated component for the logo ensures consistent handling across the application.

3. **Performance**: Setting `priority` ensures the logo is loaded as a priority resource, and `unoptimized` bypasses potential processing issues.

4. **File Access**: The direct bind mount ensures the files in the public directory are accessible without any potential volume-related issues.

## Testing

The solution should be tested by:

1. Rebuilding and starting the Docker containers
2. Verifying that the logo appears correctly on the home page and newsletter page
3. Checking browser network requests to confirm the image is loading properly

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding error boundary components for image handling
2. Set up proper monitoring for resource loading failures
3. If similar issues occur with other static files, apply the same pattern
